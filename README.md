# DriveSmartAPI
A high-performance API built in C# with PostgreSQL to assess vehicle electrical efficiency. The API calculates vehicle efficiency over various periods and accounts for time zones. This project uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) for efficient data processing and aims to optimize performance while reducing memory usage.

Features:-

Calculates vehicle efficiency based on distance traveled and fuel used.
Accounts for time zones to adjust efficiency calculations.
Built with high performance in mind, achieving a 20% improvement in data processing speed.
Designed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.
Easy to set up and deploy with PostgreSQL as the database backend.
