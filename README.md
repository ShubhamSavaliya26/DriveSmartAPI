# DriveSmartAPI
A high-performance API built in C# with PostgreSQL to assess vehicle electrical efficiency. The API calculates vehicle efficiency over various periods and accounts for time zones. This project uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) for efficient data processing and aims to optimize performance while reducing memory usage.

Features
<br>
Calculates vehicle efficiency based on distance traveled and fuel used.
<br>
Accounts for time zones to adjust efficiency calculations.
<br>
Built with high performance in mind, achieving a 20% improvement in data processing speed.
<br>
Designed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.
<br>
Easy to set up and deploy with PostgreSQL as the database backend.
